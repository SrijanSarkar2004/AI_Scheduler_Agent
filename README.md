# AI_Scheduler_Agent
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an AI-driven task scheduling system that intelligently assigns tasks to employees based on multiple real-world constraints. The system models task allocation as a decision-making problem and applies machine learning techniques to optimize assignments while balancing employee workload, skill suitability, availability, and fatigue.

A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent is used to learn optimal scheduling policies through interaction with the environment. Over time, the agent improves its assignment decisions by maximizing long-term efficiency rather than relying on static rules. This highlights the application of reinforcement learning to practical resource allocation and optimization problems.

Natural language processing is used to interpret task descriptions written in plain text. By extracting required skills and task attributes automatically, the system can match tasks to employees without requiring manually structured input. This demonstrates the integration of NLP with decision-making models in a real-world workflow.

Each employee is represented using a structured profile that includes skill sets, current workload, availability, and fatigue level. These features are incorporated into the agent’s state representation, enabling adaptive and context-aware scheduling decisions. This reflects strong skills in feature engineering and system modeling.

The project includes an interactive user interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to visualize task assignments and employee status in real time. While the interface supports demonstration and analysis, the primary focus of the project is on the underlying AI logic rather than full-stack development.

This project showcases applied skills in reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and intelligent system design. It is well suited for roles related to machine learning, applied AI, and decision-support systems, and demonstrates the ability to translate theoretical AI concepts into a working solution.
